# 2024_Global_Population-Exploratory_Data_Analysis-with_Python

### Project Overview
This repository contains data, scripts, and visualizations for exploring and analyzing global population  data for the year 2024. The goal is to provide insightful visualizations and analysis of population demographics, growth patterns, and other relevant statistics.
<hr>

### Tools and Technologies
* Python: Primary programming language used for data analysis.
* Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive data exploration and visualization.
* Pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: Python libraries for data visualization.
* Numpy: Python library used for Mathematical operations.

### About the Dataset
This dataset is downloaded from live estimated data telecasted on [worldpopulationreview.com](https://worldpopulationreview.com) on January 2024 which is part of the The US Census Bureau's world population clock.

These population estimates and projections provide the standard and consistent set of population figures that are used throughout the United Nations system.
<br>
1. The dataset comprises 234 countries along with their dependent territories.<br>
2. A dependent territory, also known as a dependent area, dependency, or external territory, lacks full political independence or sovereignty akin to a sovereign state and is politically separate from the controlling state's main region.<br>
3. The ranking of each country and its dependencies is based on population size, as established by the United Nations.<br>
4. The dataset is structured into nine columns, each containing specific information about each country and dependent territory.<br>
<hr>

#### Columns utilized for analysis:<br>

1. Country:  Names of 205 countries including dependent terroitories in the world<br>
2. Population_2024:  Current population i.e population as of January 2024<br>
3. Population_2023:  Population for the previous year i.e. 2022<br>
4. Area:  Area in kilometer square (km^2)<br>
5. Land Area:  Land area in km^2<br>
6. Density:  Population density i.e. people per sq. km of land area in /km^2<br>
7. Growth rate:  Annual growth rate where +ve and -ve signs show an increase and decrease in growth rates respectively<br>
8. World percentage:   Share of each country in total world's population in terms of percentage<br>
9. Rank:  Rank on the basis of population size, most populated country is assigned highest rank and so on<br>
